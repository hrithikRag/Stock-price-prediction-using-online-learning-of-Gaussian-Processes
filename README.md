**Project Title:** 
Predicting Monthly Stock Prices for Apple Inc. Using Gaussian Processes

**Description:**

This project focuses on the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the purpose of monthly stock price prediction, with a specific focus on Apple Inc.'s stock. The project encompasses a holistic approach to time series forecasting, from in-depth kernel analysis to model selection and evaluation.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Kernel Analysis:** The project begins with a comprehensive exploration of various kernel functions commonly used in Gaussian Processes, such as Radial Basis Function (RBF), Exponential Sine Squared, and Matern kernels. These kernels are visualized to intuitively understand their behavior and how they capture correlations across different timestamps in time series data.

- **Data Preparation:** Historical monthly stock price data for Apple Inc. is obtained, spanning from the inception of trading to the present day. The dataset is divided into two critical segments: a training set that includes historical data up to the previous year, and a test set that comprises the last 12 months of stock prices.

- **Model Training:** Gaussian Process Regression models are employed to predict monthly stock prices. A training window of 24 data points (equivalent to the last 2 years of historical data) is used to train the GP models, enabling immediate next-point predictions.

- **Model Selection:** Multiple combinations of kernel functions and hyperparameters are evaluated for model performance. The kernel with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the training data is chosen, emphasizing a data-driven approach to kernel selection and model tuning.

- **Model Evaluation:** The selected GP model's performance is assessed on the test data, and its MSE is reported to gauge the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capability.

- **Stock Price Forecasting:** The culmination of the project involves leveraging the chosen Gaussian Process model to forecast monthly stock prices for Apple Inc. for the forthcoming month, providing valuable insights into anticipated stock price trends.

**Contributions:**

This project offers practical experience in time series analysis, kernel selection, hyperparameter tuning, and predictive modeling within the context of financial forecasting. By sharing this repository, we aim to contribute to the broader data science and finance communities, fostering a deeper understanding of time series analysis and predictive modeling techniques.
